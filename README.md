# OneDrive-Python
I like Microsoft's onedrive service, and I don't know how to use it on Ubuntu. So I try to use onedrive's API to write a program. 
It has a certification procedure, you need to first registration application from the Microsoft website, but I don't know where is the problem, unable to get client ID and secret. So I use the account inside of the sample that official onedrive-sdk-python gave.
I completed basic functionality, but there are also some advanced features like Async operations, Using a Proxy not implemented.
GUI and Exception handling will be added later.
